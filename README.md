I'll use MySQL to solve the challenges.

Notes:

1. () is important in nested query
2. we can perform multiple operation after select [SELECT op1, op2.. from-----]
3. MINUS(on table) and -(arithmetic) are different
4. LENGTH() to find length 
5. LIMIT N to retrive first n row (syntax differs in other lang)
6. Every derived table must have its own alias
7. use REGEXP instead of LIKE for regex search | see other REGEXP_sdfdf | see mysql regex from GeeksForGeeks
8. UPPER or LOWER to convert string case..
9. SUBSTR or SUBSTRING (string, startindex[1 based](if negative start from last n character), length) to find substring
10. IN to check if some value exists in array.column or not
11. LEFT or RIGHT (string, length) finds substring from left.right of string
