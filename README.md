# SQL-Hackerrank


I'll use MySQL to solve the challenges.

Notes:

1. () is important in nested query
2. we can perform multiple operation after select [select op1, op2.. from-----]
3. minus(on table) and -(arithmetic) are different
4. length() to find length 
5. limit n to retrive first n row (syntax differs in other lang)
